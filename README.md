# Overview

The Decentralized Ethernet Research Protocol aims to become the platform for  
a collective-intellegence IP research network. In its later stages Derp hopes  
to become an instrument that will allow researchers and citizens access to a  
new database containing information about the software running on the Interent.  
More importantly, this will be able to determine information about the relative  
levels of security in different networks or nodes of the Interenet. The processes  
of data collection for individual nodes exists currently with applications like  
Nmap, but no program currently exists to provide collective intellegence and  
automated data analysis. Derp also aims to create an anonymous Peer-2-Peer  
network to transmit inew information among clients in the Derp Network. When  
complete Derp stands to potentially change the field of  cybersecurity.
